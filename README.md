# Higher Lower Game

A fun Python game where you guess who has more Instagram followers.

## How to Play

- You’ll see two people or brands (A and B).
- Each one shows their name, what they do, and where they're from.
- You guess who has more followers by typing **"a"** or **"b"**.
- If you’re right, your score goes up and the game continues.
- If you’re wrong, the game ends and your final score is shown.

## What You Need

- Python 3 installed

## How to Run

1. Download the files (`main.py`, `data.py`, and `art.py`)
2. Open a terminal
3. Run the game with:

```bash
python main.py
```

That’s it. Have fun and see how high you can score!
